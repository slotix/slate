# Introduction

Welcome to the Dataflow Kit (DFK) API! 

DFKâ€™s API enables you to programatically manage and run your web data extraction and conversion Tasks, and retrieve extracted data.

Quick links to DFK API services:

- [Extract web data](#extract-data-from-web)
- [Scrape search engine results (SERPs)](#extract-serps) 
- [Fetch HTML pages](#fetch-html)  
- [Make a screenshot](#take-a-screenshot)
- [Convert files to PDF](#convert-files-to-pdf)

Curl, Go, Python, Node.js, and PHP code examples are available. You can view them in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right. By default, curl is selected so that you can try out the commands in your terminal.

## Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass a valid API Key with each request
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.dataflowkit.com/v1/{API-ENDPOINT}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY -d \
'{
  "foo":"bar"
}'
```

>API-ENDPOINT corresponds to specified API endpoint. 
>Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key.

Dataflow Kit API needs to be authenticated by passing a secret API Key to all API requests to the server as the <code>api_key</code> query parameter. 

It looks like the following: 
`api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`

The API Key can be found in the [DFK Dashboard](https://account.dataflowkit.com). 


<aside class="success">
You must replace <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with your personal API key.

<aside class="warning">
IMPORTANT: Do not share the API Key with untrusted parties, or use it directly from a client-side code, unless you fully understand the consequences!
</aside>

## Versioning
All Dataflow Kit API endpoints URLs start with https://api.dataflowkit.com/v1/.

The current API version 1 is available via the /v1 prefix. 

If there are backward incompatible changes that need to be made to our API, we will release a new API version. The previous API version will be maintained for at least a year after releasing the new version.
